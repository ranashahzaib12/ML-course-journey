# **Wine Quality EDA Project with Python**  
**A Data Analytics Portfolio Project**

---

## **Introduction**  
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a wine quality dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about the factors influencing wine quality. The project showcases data analytics and visualization skills using Python, making it a strong portfolio project for demonstrating expertise in data-driven decision-making.

The dataset includes features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and more, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting wine quality.

---

## **Abstract**  
The project begins with importing necessary Python libraries and loading the dataset. Key steps include:
- Inspecting the dataset for missing values and anomalies.
- Performing univariate and bivariate analyses.
- Applying feature engineering to enhance the dataset for better insights.
- Creating meaningful visualizations to highlight trends and relationships.

This project provides valuable insights into wine quality characteristics and demonstrates proficiency in Python for data analytics.

## **Details of the Analysis**

### **1. Importing Libraries**  
To perform data analysis and visualization, the following libraries were utilized:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating compelling visualizations.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

---

### **2. Loading the Dataset**  
The dataset, containing details of wine quality attributes, was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
```python
df = pd.read_csv('winequality.csv')
df.head()  # Inspect the first few rows
df.info()  # Summary of columns and data types
```

---

### **3. Data Cleaning**  
Cleaning tasks were focused on ensuring data quality and reliability:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing or invalid data were removed or imputed.
- **Outlier Detection**: Univariate analysis was performed to identify anomalies in numerical features.

```python
# Handling missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Detecting and visualizing outliers
sns.boxplot(df['alcohol'])
plt.title('Alcohol Content Distribution')
plt.show()
```

---

### **4. Data Exploration**  
**Exploratory Analysis** was conducted to uncover patterns in the data:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examined distributions of individual features such as alcohol content, acidity, and wine quality scores.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzed relationships between features to uncover trends affecting quality.

```python
# Correlation heatmap
corr = df[['alcohol', 'pH', 'citric acid', 'density', 'quality']].corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

---

### **5. Feature Engineering**  
New features were derived to enhance the analysis:
- **Quality Categories**: Grouped wine into quality ranges (e.g., low, medium, high).
- **Alcohol-Density Ratio**: Created a feature to explore its effect on quality.

```python
df['quality_category'] = pd.cut(df['quality'], bins=[0, 5, 7, 10], labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
df['alcohol_density_ratio'] = df['alcohol'] / df['density']
```

---

### **6. Visualizations**  
The analysis emphasizes **visual storytelling**, with insights presented through:
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Identified relationships between features.
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(),annot=True)
```

- **Bar Charts**: Compared average wine quality across alcohol levels.

```
df.quality.value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.xlabel("Wine Quality")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

```
- **Scatter Plots**: Analyzed the Alchol and pH w.r.t Quality of Wine.
sns.scatterplot(x='alcohol',y='pH',hue='quality',data=df)
```

### **7. Key Insights Derived**  
Some critical insights include:
- Alcohol content has a strong positive correlation with wine quality.
- pH and citric acid levels show moderate relationships with wine quality.
- Wines with higher alcohol and balanced acidity tend to score better.
