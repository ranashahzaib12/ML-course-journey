# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific machine learning algorithm. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that explain the theoretical concepts, demonstrate practical implementations, and provide example use cases with datasets. The corresponding CSV files serve as input datasets for the notebooks.
